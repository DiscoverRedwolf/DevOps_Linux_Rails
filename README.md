<strong>Company</strong><strong> </strong>

This young and vibrant company is a leading technology and business platform used globally. Headquartered in Australia (50 people) and offices in America (25 people) and Europe, there are a lot of growth and travel opportunities for the right people.

With spacious workspaces in South Melbourne that include a coffee machine, and large communal kitchen, there is a great energy and momentum in this place

&nbsp;

<strong>Opportunity</strong>

Work with one of Australia’s top custom built e-commerce and digital marketing platforms. It’s a small team and agile team where your decisions matter. We need an experienced DevOps engineer to take over the existing server and deployment architecture and help rebuild it from the ground up.

This position will include mentoring developers in infrastructure tasks and doing some web development. You'll be responsible for the overall direction of the server architecture, and as such, how future applications should be structured around this architecture.

You will be working on a regionally distributed, dedicated server based infrastructure. It's reliable, and deployments are seamless, but they are reaching its limits and would like to re-invent it. Right now the team is considering a combination of cloud-based hosting, containerisation, and origin-pull CDN. What do you think? Your opinion matters.

&nbsp;

<strong>To be successful, you will need experience with</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Linux systems administration</li>
	<li>Operations on a customer-visible product</li>
	<li>Modern containerisation &amp; virtualisation platforms</li>
	<li>Agile or Scrum team environments</li>
	<li>Automated configuration management (e.g. Chef, Puppet, Ensile, Babushka)</li>
	<li>At least one dynamic language (e.g. Perl, Python, Ruby) and one MVC web platform (e.g. Rails, Laravel, Django)</li>
	<li>ElasticSearch</li>
	<li>AWS and/or DigitalOcean</li>
	<li>Docker</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>Newrelic, Pagerduty, Datadog and/or ServerDensity</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>What’s in it for you?</strong><strong> </strong>

You'll be part of a small team where you will have direct input into the architectural &amp; design decisions made. You will be provided with top-of-the-line computer equipment and software you need. Go to RailsCamp, Ruby Conf and more and get paid for it!

If you would like more information about this fantastic opportunity, please contact Bart Wolkowski via apply@redwolfconsulting.com.au or on 0404 499 046, referencing the Job Title at the top of the page.
